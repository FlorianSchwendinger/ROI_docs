## Why **ROI** loads so slowly?
**ROI** loads all the plug-ins automatically this takes time one can
avoid this by setting the environment variable `ROI_LOAD_PLUGINS` to `FALSE`
`Sys.setenv(ROI_LOAD_PLUGINS = "FALSE")`. The main reason why the loading 
of the package takes so much time is that many optimization solvers use
the **Matrix** package which takes quite some time to load.
In the long run we will try remove this overhead by replacing the
**Matrix** package with **slam** not only in the plug-ins but also
in the wrapped packages.
