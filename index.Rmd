# **ROI** 

The R Optimization Infrastructure (ROI) package provides an extensible 
infrastructure to model linear, quadratic, conic and general nonlinear 
optimization problems in a consistent way. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ROI)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(ROI_LOAD_PLUGINS = "FALSE")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ROI))
```

Furthermore, the infrastructure administers many different solvers, 
reformulations, problem collections and functions to read and write 
optimization problems in various formats.

# Extensions

**ROI** provides the modeling capabilities and manages the plugins, the plugins
add the solvers to **ROI**.


### Plugins

````{r, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
plugins <- ROI_available_solvers()[,c("Package", "Repository")]
plugins <- aggregate(Repository ~ Package,  data = plugins, 
                     FUN = paste, collapse = ", ")
knitr::kable(plugins, row.names = TRUE)
```

  abstract = {Optimization plays an important role in many methods routinely 
    used in statistics, machine learning and data science. Often, 
    implementations of these methods rely on highly specialized (non-reusable) 
    optimization algorithms. However, in many instances recent advances, in 
    particular in the field of convex optimization, make it possible to 
    conveniently and straightforwardly use modern solvers (reusable) instead
    with the advantage of enabling broader usage scenarios and thus
    promoting reusability. This paper introduces the ROI
    (R Optimization Infrastructure) package which provides an
    extensible infrastructure to model linear, quadratic, conic and general
    nonlinear optimization problems in a consistent way. Furthermore, the
    infrastructure administers many different solvers, reformulations,
    problem collections and functions to read and write optimization
    problems in various formats.}
